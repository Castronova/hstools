# Welcome to HSTools

A humble collection of HydroShare tools written in Python 3. The `hstools` library was originally a port of the CUAHSI JupyterHub `utilities.hydroshare` package modified to work on desktop computers. The goal is to provide a set of basic functions that simplify working with HydroShare data.
